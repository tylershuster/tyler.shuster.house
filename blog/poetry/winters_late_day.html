      <h1>Winter's Late Day</h1>
      
      <p>In the winter’s late day,</p><p>When the final strands of sunlight</p><p>Brush through the snow-bathed aspen</p><p>And the crisp blueness of the air</p><p>Blankets the earth in implacable quiet,</p><p>We are, more than you.</p><p>In the damp, we were born in darkness,</p><p>Into the cool eden we grew—before time was named</p><p>Or knowledge grew in flowering fruits.</p><p>                Before you grew to be, we were,</p><p>                Before you opened your eyes, we had seen the world,</p><p>                And before you took your first breath,</p><p>we had made the air from sulfure</p><p>and from ether.</p><p>Your first steps were on our upturned face,</p><p>And in our body you will be buried, alone with us,</p><p>For no one lasts forever.</p><p>You first made love in our bed, under our blankets—</p><p>Our blankets and the trees’—</p><p>Who had seen your ardor grow beneath their branches.</p><p>You ran to us when love had left you,</p><p>Entreating us of your bloodied soul</p><p>—and we had held you, wrapped you in verdancy</p><p>Until your tears abated.</p><p>We remained as you ran to war,</p><p>And mourned your youth, grown in our garden,</p><p>Shorn by sword and scythe,</p><p>And harvested in fields of battle.</p><p>We have seen your quarrels and we are unimpressed.</p><p>Your fervor and your fury amount to nothing,</p><p>And as we are, you are discontent to be.</p><p>We are the soft omnipotent mosses, the great transcendent us</p><p>And when you have had your fill of trying,</p><p>You will join our being, errant son of earth.</p></p><p>
