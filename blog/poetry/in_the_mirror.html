      <p>Every time I see a mirror</p><p>I see my self a little clearer</p><p>But a little of his insanity</p><p>Finds the route back into me</p></p><p><p>(So many words wound into my countenance - they don&#39;t fucking count!)</p></p><p><aside></p><p>All this vapid timidity dissolving my ability to speak POWER into the weakened earth</p><p>It is not what I was born with and I do not accept it</p><p>begone feeble bleatings and muttered mumblings choked by fear!</p><p>You have no place in heaven drawing near</p><p></aside></p><p></p><p><p>I&#39;ve been the problem for far too long</p><p>trying to be the best instead of getting along.</p><p>I hold it over people&#39;s heads</p><p>that I got given more than them.</p></p><p><p>Take the shame away, the want for fame away;</p><p>It&#39;s fucking toxic, obnoxious to me &amp; others</p><p>Making jealous my brothers,</p><p>&amp; sisters - all wishing</p><p>just to <em>end</em> with what I was begun with.</p><p>Get rid of it all; let it fall:</p><p>    The pall that warps my words into worthless forms -</p><p>    The first hurt that makes me fuck instead of making Love -</p><p>    The lie that said getting high was better than wri-</p><p>    ting or breathing mindfully -</p><p>    the later that poisoned my now.</p></p><p><p>I have become an asshole</p><p>but let me be one, if you would,</p><p>let me recycle something good</p></p><p><p>I am one channel of the fuck-lusting stereo-</p><p>type I can never use again, bro;</p><p>I have pursued every sin, though</p><p>I have been warned against it;</p><p>I persist despite the wishes I insist exist</p></p><p><p>I am still more anti- than Christ;</p><p>I know judgement persists so</p><p>    my only hope</p><p>is this: grace -</p><p>Let me see my face</p><p>    and hate</p><p>it and love it and let it go forever</p><p>and I will see someone different in the mirror</p><p><span style="text-align:right"></p><p>when I need to look &amp; maybe they will forgive</p><p>    the last one to vis</span></p><p>it, the has-been who wish-ed this</p></p><p><p>This can be your salvation -</p><p>The earth belching from intoxication</p><p>and the millenia of rebelliousness</p><p>vomited forth as hellish shit</p><p>and every twisted inconsistency is hit</p><p>    let go or go with it.</p><p>The braid is unbound / now.</p><p>This can still be your salvation you who have tested the grace of God</p><p>You are being reborn in-</p><p>    to the pain you bore</p><p>This can be your fucking salvation: choose to endure while Endurance is near</p><p>DO NO VIOLENCE and let yourself die</p><p>Watch the winging birds &amp; share their flight</p><p>Escape in the bubbles of fate&#39;s last gasp rising years later to the placid light</p></p><p>
