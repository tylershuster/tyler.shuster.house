      <h1>Firecracker</h1>
      
      <p>I do not feel your grief and your tears are not mine,</p><p>nor is your country.</p><p>But I bleed and I bruise, even as you are torn apart.</p><p>And I love and I lose, even as you die naked in your streets.</p><p>And I hope for more even as you lose all that you once had fighting that your children may live to see a tomorrow.</p><p>A tomorrow free of dismembered corpses rotting in ash and a tomorrow where the sun is not obscured by the fire of a nation’s hate against itself—of one man’s crusade.</p><p>For we are both men—flesh and blood, though you more than I,</p><p>And we both live, though you more than I, even while less.</p><p>And we both hope, though you simpler, though you greater.</p><p>And we both die, though you sooner, though you never.</p><p>My struggles are but firecrackers and I jump to hear them and I bitch and i call my senator and pass a law to outlaw firecrackers.</p><p>But yours-yours are the coordinated missile strikes of a man you once trusted</p><p>—and all you can do is hope—</p><p>hope that a picture of your severed torso</p><p>—you and your brother’s(whom you loved so dearly)—</p><p>will touch the calloused heart of someone who can change something—anything.</p><p>And maybe—maybe—you will have changed the world.</p><p>But you will unquestionably have lived a better life than I—a child who jumps at firecrackers.</p></p><p>
