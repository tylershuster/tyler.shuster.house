      <p>I&#39;m looking for enough.</p><p>Tell me; who has enough?</p></p><p><hr></p><p><p>I&#39;ve seen people who&#39;ve had enough</p><p>and everyone wants enough,</p><p>but I know nearly no one who knows they have enough</p></p><p><hr></p><p><p>People who know they have enough are the hardest to find</p><p>because when you <em>have</em> enough,</p><p>you <em>know</em> you&#39;ve had enough,</p><p>and you can&#39;t have just enough anymore,</p><p>like an or-</p><p>     gasm, and nothing will do</p><p>just <em>that</em> anymore.</p></p><p><hr></p><p><p>But it&#39;s true that enough won&#39;t come to you - </p><p>you have to make it come.</p></p><p><hr></p><p><p>To dance <em>with</em> enough and not to cease it in its flight,</p><p>To do this now because it&#39;s right,</p><p>to never stop, to never know,</p><p>to never make by measuring slow,</p><p>to always come and never go</p></p><p><hr></p><p><p>have you had enough of wanting enough?</p><p>If you have enough, say so when offered something else,</p><p>Because enough will never be a thing by a different name</p></p><p>
