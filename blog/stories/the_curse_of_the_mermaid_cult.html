      <h1>Cereal Killer</h1>
      
      <p>Entry One:</p></p><p><p>I have begun to become aware of an epidemic that ran rampant on the planet in the early years of the twenty-first century and which continued for approximately a hundred years. It seems as if the primitive natives at the time worshipped a goddess who was half fish and half-woman. I have uncovered several ancient tablets with her portraiture on them, and am interested in pursuing the meaning of them further. Who was this goddess? What did she represent? Why were so many shrines built to her? I will have to investigate this.</p></p><p><p>Entry six:</p></p><p><p>I have discovered that the creature in question is referred to as a mermaid. The mermaid comes from an even more ancient mythology, one originating in Europe. Over the years, many believed that the manatees were in fact these creatures. However, the manatees emphatically deny this and in the early years of their consciousness had to distance themselves from this comparison. It is unknown whether or not mermaids actually existed, although the large number of shrines to the creatures seems to indicate some sort of belief. There seems to be more than one mermaid in folklore of the time, but only one depicted on the tablets. Perhaps the people of this time were not as advanced as they claimed to be. It is growing more and more clear that they worshipped this being and visited her shrines regularly.</p></p><p><p>In fact, the exponential growth of this cult is hard to explain, especially by the standards of the time. Within a decade of the cult’s inception, it had spread all over the world. It seems as if it actually took precedence over other religions held by its adherents. Unless I find out the proper name, it will be referred to as the mermaid cult.</p></p><p><p>Entry twelve:</p></p><p><p>The mermaid cult is proving elusive to track down particulars of. However, I have recovered documents that seem to indicate the use of psychoactive drugs as being associated with the cult. Apparently, believers in the cult would ingest stimulants at the shrine, which they would then take with them to their various places of work.</p></p><p><p>This stimulant, which I have not yet been able to translate into a modern dialect, seemed to be highly addictive, which may explain the success of the cult. Adherents were trained from a young age to regularly dose themselves with the drug, some even starting around the age of 5. It seems a very primitive arrangement indeed. Dependence on this drug slowly grew until adolescence or young adulthood, at which point consumption spiked. The drug upset delicate brain chemistry, and led to violent outbreaks and social disorders. As dependence on the drug grew, users made regular donations to the mermaid cult, the frequency of which increased at an alarming rate. I shudder to think of the primitive and barbaric nature of these addicts.</p></p><p><p>Entry seventeen:</p></p><p><p>For some reason, it seems as if the mermaid cult had very little cultural opposition. In fact, key members of governments all over the world were card-carrying constituents of the cult, a fact that was public knowledge. Addiction to the mermaid drug was deemed socially acceptable, even considering the terrifying long-term effects of its abuse. The horrifying fervor with which the cultists adhered to the drug is a truly terrifying example of the effects of addiction. Symptoms included headaches, disrupted sleep, anxiety disorders, high blood pressure, diabetes, and depression. It also contributed to heart disease, which was the number one cause of death at the time of the cult’s existence. It seems as if the medical authorities at the time were aware of these risks, but did nothing to limit the public’s exposure to it.</p></p><p><p>I still have not discovered the significance of the mermaid symbology, a problem that has continued to irritate me. It seems to have no connection with the drug that it represents. Additionally, I have found no additional objects of worship, although it does seem as if many believers would bring in their prayer books to read and to inscribe their devotions in. These books, as pictures taken during that time would suggest, were usually emblazoned with a glowing symbol, and carved out of metal, possibly alluminium. It is hard to tell from the images.</p></p><p><p>Entry twenty-five:</p></p><p><p>I have reached the full extent of my investigation of the mermaid cult. It seems as if they were destroyed by their own devices. Over the period of a hundred years, the drug’s effects took its toll on the adherents, which either abandoned their addiction or were bred out of the gene pool. The popularity of the cult declined and eventually disappeared by the middle of the twenty-second century. A number of other, related cults sprang up during that time but were also gone quickly. I have not yet been able to find a modern equivalent for the drug used by the cultists, and the chemical name is far too long for it to be known by, so I will refer to it simply as the Curse of the Mermaid Cult. Perhaps one day someone will be able to transliterate the original pronunciation.</p></p><p><p>As for the symbolism of the mermaid, I am to this day confounded by its use. Certain clues suggest that it was drawn from an ancient text named “Moby Dick,” while others insinuate that it references a prophetic transmission entitled “BSG,” but it may never be known what the strange mermaid goddess represented or why her shrines were uniquely so successful. In any case, the Curse of the Mermaid cult is a valuable anthropological lesson, and contains many useful musings on the nature of society. I hope that some day more learned scholars than I can continue this work.</p></p><p>
