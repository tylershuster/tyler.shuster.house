      <h1>Volcano Farm</h1>
      
      <p>Once, a very long time ago, there was a man who owned a volcano farm.</p></p><p><p>He grew many volcanoes and when other people needed them, he would send his volcanoes to many parts of the world. The volcanoes provided light and heat for everyone and most of the time they were happy volcanoes. The man prided himself on having the best-behaved volcanoes in the world. Everyone loved his volcanoes because they were so well-behaved. They were such well-behaved volcanoes because he took good care of them. He fed them the best soil and the richest sulphur and made sure that, when they were young, their messes were cleaned up. The man was very happy and took pride in his work and therefore he grew the best volcanoes. There were other men that grew volcanoes, but they did not take care of their volcanoes like he did.</p></p><p><p>One day a stranger came to him and said that he had heard of his volcanoes all over the world. He had heard that the magnificent volcanoes that he saw everywhere were all grown by the same man. The stranger wanted to help the man grow volcanoes. The man asked the stranger why he was so interested in volcanoes. The stranger told the man that he wanted to see volcanoes everywhere because they were so beautiful and well-behaved.</p></p><p><p>At first the man was wary of the stranger. He had never worked with anyone before, but so many people did want volcanoes that he was finding it hard to grow as many as he needed. He told the stranger that he would consider his offer. In the meantime, the stranger could stay at his house.</p></p><p><p>The man thought about the stranger&rsquo;s offer that night, and it kept him up for a very long time.</p></p><p><p>The next morning, the man awoke much later than usual. He realised he had overslept and that the volcanoes were in need of care. He went outside and found the stranger working in his fields already. Much to his surprise, his volcanoes were growing taller and larger than ever before. The man had never prided himself on having the largest volcanoes, only the best-behaved ones. He asked the stranger what he had done, and the stranger said that it was his secret and that if he could help the man, his volcanoes would grow larger than ever. The man was so overwhelmed by the size of his volcanoes that he accepted the stranger&rsquo;s offer on the spot.</p></p><p><p>The man&rsquo;s customers were so happy about the size of the volcanoes that they ordered more than ever before. The man had to hire new help to deal with all the demand.</p></p><p><p>One day, the man decided to take a vacation around the world and see how his volcanoes were doing. He had never done so, but had always heard tell of how good his volcanoes were.</p></p><p><p>But when he visited Italy, he found that one of his volcanoes had thrown a tantrum and killed many people. &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;this will simply not do.&rdquo; he wondered how his other volcanoes were doing.</p></p><p><p>So he travelled around the world.</p></p><p><p>In California, many of his volcanoes were being very ill-behaved and in Indonesia none of the volcanoes would even listen to him. They just belched fire when he tried to talk. Even in Scandinavia where his volcanoes had always been very peaceful, they misbehaved.</p></p><p><p>The man returned home to his farm and found that the stranger and the new hires had crammed too many volcanoes into the small space and no longer tended carefully to them.</p></p><p><p>The stranger told him how much money they had been making from volcano sales. The man tried to stop him, but it was too late.</p></p><p><p>No one wanted to buy volcanoes anymore. They were no longer good.</p></p><p><p>The volcano farm went out of business shortly afterward and the stranger and all the people he had hired left.</p></p><p><p>And the man lay upon the earth where he had once farmed volcanoes. In his great sadness, his body sunk into the ground and became one with it. And to this day, whenever the earth springs forth geysers, the man is crying for his lost volcanoes.</p></p><p>
