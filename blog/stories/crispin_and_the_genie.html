      <h1>Crispin and the Genie</h1>
      
      <p>September 16, 2011</p></p><p><p>Crispin was not in the point of his life that he’d ever hope to refer to as his “prime.” He still held hope that one day he would lay claim to that period, but he prayed to God that these days and long hours would, in retrospect, not be the best he ever had.</p><p>He worked in Waste Processing Facility. The dump, he reminded himself. The dump. I work at the dump. With waste. No, with shit, sometimes literal shit. I work at the dump and I work with shit.</p><p>He’d say he’d had prouder moments, but then again, he hadn’t.</p><p>It was 5:55 and almost time to head home for the day. He was the last one in the building and was turning off the massive fluorescent lights above the yard of scrap and abandoned capitalist hopes. A gleam caught his eye before he shut the final breaker. It was a lamp of some sort, like one of those old genie lamps from Disney movies and naïve childhoods. He picked it up and looked at the grimy, scum-soaked reflection in the tarnished gold. He rubbed a thumb to clear away the grease. The lamp shook and glowed. He dropped it in shock. Steam began to hiss from the spout and Crispin stepped back. When the vapour had cleared, Crispin found himself staring at a spectral man standing there. The man slowly materialised in a way that he could only describe as solidifying. He was dressed in a sharp suit and tie, hands in his pockets. He looked faintly Arabian – like an oil cartel representative. He was staring off nonchalantly and then turned to look Crispin in the eyes.</p><p>They both stood there, without words. The man spoke. “Hey. I’m Gene.” The man was calm, collected, professional, not at all shaken by his materialisation out of vapour from a lamp in an dump.</p><p>“Hi…Gene.” Crispin said, unsure of his own existence.</p><p>“Look, Crispin, this is getting old for me, so I’ll cut to the chase.” He lost a little of his professional demeanour and now had the look of a man whose job had so completely wearied him that he had begun to breed apathy. “I’m a genie. Yeah yeah, genies aren’t real, heard it all. But then again, men coming out of lamps isn’t real either so you’ve got to pick your poison.”</p><p>“I don’t understand.” Crispin said.</p><p>Gene rolled his eyes. “You never do. I’ll lay it out for you. I can give you one wish. None of that more wishes crap and you’re not going to fool me with some clever little scheme to get more wishes. One wish, anything you want. Love, power, money, it’s yours.”</p><p>Crispin looked dubious. There was no way to accept that this was real, but he couldn’t doubt it – given what he had just witnessed. He decided to accept blind faith and play along. But he couldn’t think of what he wanted right now. There was so much that he could ask for.</p><p>“When do I have to tell you by?”</p><p>“Tonight,” Gene said.</p><p>“Is there anything else that I should know about this deal?”</p><p>“Not really. We’ll see. What do you want?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Crispin said. “Can we talk about it?”</p><p>“Sure,” the genie said. “Talk’s free.”</p><p>“I’ve got to sit down.” They went to the breakroom and sat across from each other at a table. Crispin wiped his perspiring forehead with a palm. “What do people usually ask for?”</p><p>“Can’t tell you that,” Gene said.</p><p>“I thought you said…”</p><p>“My rules.” That was all he said.</p><p>“Alright, so let me tell you about myself. I’m just trying to think here. I’m a guy in my mid-twenties working a crap job; I’ve got no girlfriend, no money, and no future. I’d like all three. What if I just wished to be happy?”</p><p>“There’s no way to gauge happiness, Crispin.”</p><p>“How did you…”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter. My point is, there’s no way to measure how happy you are. You can always be happier. And the things that make you happy now won’t make you happy later, but you’ll wish they did. Happiness is too nebulous. No matter what you got, you’d want more. Perfect happiness doesn’t exist. But good thinking. Tell me more.”</p><p>Crispin looked disappointed. “I suppose I could just ask for a lot of money.”</p><p>“You could.”</p><p>“But I’d feel selfish. And too much money and I’d cause inflation.” He looked at Gene. “I’m not an idiot you know; I’m just working this…”</p><p>Gene looked at him with a look that said he already knew and that it didn’t matter how.</p><p>“And I could ask for love, but that would probably just end and I’d be heartbroken and so would she.”</p><p>“It’s happened.”</p><p>“I could rid the world of disease, but then everyone would find some new way to kill each other and discriminate against those they didn’t like.”</p><p>“That’s one possibility.”</p><p>“I could provide all the food for everyone, but then it would just lead to obesity and high blood pressure and people would be less healthy.”</p><p>“Could be.”</p><p>“I don’t suppose I can ask for multiple things in one wish?”</p><p>A smile. “No.”</p><p>“Well, I could…” Crispin trailed off. Everything he could think of had a downside that was worse than any benefits. Every problem solved created a new one. Perhaps this was the genie’s plan. He looked up at him and stared into his eyes. They were like universes, entire existences of thought beyond the human plane. And it scared him. The infinite experience of possibility loomed at him from within the recesses of this mysterious, ageless man’s pupil. Gene blinked and Crispin came back to the stark, small reality in which he now sat.</p><p>“See something?” Gene asked.</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>“You just jumped. See something.”</p><p>“No, no, nothing,” said Crispin. “Just thinking. Tell me, what’s it like being a genie?”</p><p>“What’s it like being a human?”</p><p>“What kind of shit question is that?”</p><p>“You can’t tell me what it’s like to be a human – you’ve never been anything else. Being a genie’s like being anything else – it doesn’t matter what you ARE, it matter what you do with it.”</p><p>“Alright, I see.” Crispin looked down for a moment. “Alright then, what do you do with it? Being a genie I mean.”</p><p>“I grant people wishes. Not every genie does, but it’s what makes me happy – it gives me a reason to get up in the morning.”</p><p>“So you mean there are other genie…jobs?”</p><p>“Of course; we can do anything we want. Just like you humans.”</p><p>“But we can’t just do anything we want here on earth. We’ve got to work so that we get money.”</p><p>“And does that money make you happy?”</p><p>“Of course.” Gene looked at Crispin suspiciously. “Alright, sometimes.” The stare continued. “What?”</p><p>“What makes you happy, Crispin Fields? Does money make you happy? Do you curl up with your dollar bills at night and smile peacefully? Would you even if you were rich? What makes you happy?”</p><p>Crispin sat back and thought for a few moments. “Nothing.”</p><p>“That’s right, Crispin.” Gene looked weary. “Nothing. You can’t think of anything that makes you happy and do you know why?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“You’re chasing happiness – I used to do that when I was young. Happiness is always in the future, am I right? There’s always one thing left to do before you’ll be happy, one thing that’s wrong and so you say damn it all and you just make money because it’s the only thing you really know how to do and why? Because you’ve been sold on the idea that money and the love of a beautiful woman and power will bring you happiness – in fact, you’ve been sold on the idea that those things ARE happiness and without them, you’ll never be happy.”</p><p>“That’s what everyone thinks, and it makes them happy.”</p><p>“No, Crispin, it doesn’t. Do people think you’re happy?”</p><p>“My friends do, yeah. I smile I guess.”</p><p>“Are you happy?”</p><p>“Not really. But I mean like other people actually are happy – not just this fake happy like…” he trailed off as he realised there was no way to ever tell how truly happy someone was.</p><p>“Chasing happiness, Crispin.”</p><p>“What do you recommend?”</p><p>“Be happy, Crispin. Find something that makes you happy and stick with it. Like I said before, if you always strive to be happier, you’ll just end up with more dissatisfaction.”</p><p>“But nothing makes me happy.”</p><p>Gene sighed. “You do enjoy some things, right?”</p><p>“Yes, I suppose.”</p><p>“Do them.”</p><p>“But they won’t make me money.”</p><p>“Why do you want money?”</p><p>“So I can be happy…oh.”</p><p>The two men stared at each other for a while in the flickering overhead lights of the breakroom.</p><p>Crispin was confused, vastly more confused than he had ever been. This was a new universe of possibilities, of potential. And it terrified him. It was as if he had opened a door and stepped out into the infinite space – he was drifting without direction.</p><p>“I wish to have never met you.”</p><p>Gene sighed. “I’d have hoped you’d be different.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“That’s what everyone says – they’re too entrenched in a way of viewing the world that they’ve condemned themselves to living in.”</p><p>“You mean..”</p><p>“Yes. Every single person I’ve made my offer to has decided to never have met me.” He walked back outside to the lamp laying on the cold concrete. “This is where we say goodbye.”</p><p>“Wait,” Crispin said. Gene had already begun to fade.</p><p>“Too late,” he said.</p><p>“I wish something would make me happy,” he said softly and with an overcoming regret.</p><p>“You got it.” And Gene was gone – the lamp as well.</p><p>Crispin shook his head and tried to recapture the last hour, but it faded like the tendrils of a powernap dream. He decided to ignore the feeling and it disappeared soon as he turned off the last breaker. He took the last bus home. He sat in the plastic seat and shook from side to side with the vibrations of the ill-maintained road. He reached a hand into his pocket and pulled out a notepad he kept as a todo list, and with a pen borrowed from the young blonde woman sitting next to him, he began to draw.</p><p>Crispin smiled.</p></p><p>
