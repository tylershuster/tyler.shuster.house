      <h1>Cereal Killer</h1>
      
      <p>“Breaking news!”</p><p>The Jones family stared over at the TV screen. They were having dinner. It was roast beef and mashed potatoes, their favorite.</p><p>“Breaking news!” the announcer repeated. “Early this morning, a serial killer escaped from the New York city jail. As of yet, he has not been found. Please remain calm and stay home. The police are on his trail and will find him soon. More at six.” The image changed to a commercial for Trix. William Jones turned the TV off.</p><p>“I wonder…” he began. The phone rang. He got up and walked over to answer it. Looking at the caller ID, he picked the phone up.</p><p>“Right chief. Be right there.” He hung up and turned to his family. “They want me to come down to headquarters. They’re summoning all units to help on the trail of the killer.”</p><p>Valerie, his daughter, looked shocked. “Daddy, are you going to come back?”</p><p>“Of course I am.” He replied. “I always do.” He went to his bedroom to get changed and came out thirty seconds later, dressed in his suit. “Remember kids, don’t open the door for anyone until I get back.”</p><p>“When’s mommy going to be back?”</p><p>“Tomorrow. She’s on a retreat.”</p><p>“I’m scared.”</p><p>“I know. Thomas will take care of you.” Valerie was seven, Thomas a very rambunctious twelve. Both were trained to use a gun, though Valerie never looked at the things. They lived in a small suburb outside New York in a small three-bedroom house.</p><p>Entering the house, you would find a large living room adjacent to the kitchen. Directly off the kitchen was the laundry room. William knew the dangers of living in this area, but he couldn’t find a job anywhere else.</p><p>He left out the front door, securely latching it behind him. He waved to his children as he walked to the garage. Thomas waved back. Valerie sucked her thumb.</p></p><p><p>“Well, chief, what’s the situation?” Mr. Jones asked on entering the station.</p><p>“There have been no victims as of yet, but we haven’t found him either. Any ideas?”</p><p>“Not a clue.” William walked over to a map on the wall, decorated with lights. The lights were to show what part of their district a crime occurred in, if someone called 911. While he was gazing, a light near the edge of the district started flashing. It was in a row of apartments. The whole office jumped ad the sound of the alarm ringing. The chief answered the phone.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“I…I saw someone leaving the apartment next to ours.” The woman’s voice was hysteric. “He was carrying a box of some sort. He was hooded and wore army fatigue. He was running real fast. Do you think he could be the…the…killer?”</p><p>“Maybe, ma’am. We’ll send some men there to investigate.” He hung up and turned. “Jones, go there with Timmons. If there are any casualties, call HQ.”</p><p>Mr. Jones holstered his pistol. “Sir!” He left for the garage with Timmons.</p></p><p><p>They arrived there a few minutes later. On the outside, the apartment complex looked the same. They ran up flights of stairs to the room number the neighbor had specified. As they entered, the room was a mess. The contents of cupboards lay on the ground, the whole house looked like it had been gone over very thoroughly. William looked around the rooms. In one room, a very fat man lay on his bed, half hanging over. He shook the man. He didn’t move. Jones took his pulse. Still there. The man then rose groggily.</p><p>“What…what are you?’</p><p>Jones pulled out his badge. “William Jones, NYPD.”</p><p>“Why are you here?”</p><p>“Sir, your house has been broken into. We received a call from your neighbor.”</p><p>“What?” he got up and searched the house, checking everywhere. Finally he stopped back where Jones was still standing. “They didn’t take anything. That’s weird.”</p><p>“Sorry about the confusion. We heard he was a serial killer, but…what’s this?” Jones stooped down to read something.</p><p>“I got it. You’ll never catch me.” He read. “Odd.”</p><p>“Well, sorry, I guess. Want some rice krispies while you’re here?”</p><p>“Sure!” Timmons yelled from the living room.</p><p>The man ambled over to the cupboards and looked inside. He stopped in shock.</p><p>“They’re gone!”</p><p>“What are?”</p><p>“My Rice Krispies!”</p></p><p><p>Thomas fired. He fired again and retreated.</p><p>“To my left!” He told Valerie, who complied.</p><p>He held a pistol in either hand. Valerie held a pistol and a needler. The Flood were advancing. He lobbed a grenade over her head. It exploded in a flash of light. He glanced out the window. In the gathering dusk, he could see a dark figure advancing in the driveway. Thomas looked closer. The man held a knife.</p><p>“Valerie, come with me!” He held her hand and ran into the laundry room and locked the door. They panted as they heard the handle being rattled at the door. There was a tinkling of glass as the man broke through the window. His feet crunched the glass as he walked through. They could hear the screams of their characters dying, then an electrical fizz. They heard his boots walk into the kitchen. He walked around, and then returned to the kitchen. The cupboards opened, then closed, and the man left the house. Thomas and Valerie opened the door slowly. The man was far down the driveway. Thomas looked to his right. The TV had a huge gash in it from the man’s knife. He walked into the kitchen. He looked into the cupboard and saw a sight he would forever remember.</p></p><p><p>“Another 911, Jones. It’s coming from your house. I hope your kids are alright.”</p><p>Mr. Jones drove to his house at full speed, his sirens blaring. Finally he reached the house. It was night now. He walked up to his home and studied the broken glass.</p><p>“Kids?” he yelled, opening the door. They came running up to him.</p><p>“Dad, they took…”</p></p><p><p>“We have a hostage situation, repeat, we have a hostage situation.”</p><p>“Hostages?”</p><p>Mr. Jones scanned the window of the house with his binoculars.</p><p>“Oh, man, this guy’s a real nut. A real Grape Nut.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“It looks like he’s got the Captain, Lucky, and…Oh my gosh!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“He’s already killed three!”</p><p>“Who are the victims?”</p><p>“Snap, Crackle, and Pop. He’s aiming his gun at Lucky now.”</p><p>Inside the house, the remains of a Rice Krispies box lay on the floor. The suspect was aiming his gun, a berretta .45 at the box of Lucky Charms now.</p><p>“What are your demands?” Jones yelled through the microphone.</p><p>“I want free breakfast for the rest of my life!”</p><p>“We might be able to arrange that.” Jones stepped forward.</p><p>“Don’t.” He heard the captain say behind him. They heard a gun fire.</p><p>“Hostage down, repeat, hostage down!” Timmons yelled. “He shot Lucky. Darn it, he’ll pay!”</p><p>Jones swore. A hostage lay dead because of him. Into his radio, “Come behind him.” He saw a shady figure rush through the bushes behind the house. Timmons was scaling the wall. He shot a grappling gun over the edge and grabbed on to the Captain Crunch box. The suspect fired again and again at the box as it disappeared over the edge, but he was too late. It vanished down the side of the house.</p><p>“You have no reason now to be there. Come out, and we will give you a fair trial.”</p><p>The suspect grinned and reached within his coat. “I have…” he pulled out a Trix box.</p><p>“He’s got children and a rabbit! Timmons, get that box! The suspect whirled around and aimed at the window, ducking out of sight of the other officers. “Abort!” Jones yelled into the mic.</p><p>He decided to reason. “Look, you have the winning Trix box. Just use the money from that and you can have free breakfasts.”</p><p>The suspect looked at the box in his hands. “Really?” Timmons clubbed him over the head. He dropped down. Timmons picked the box up.</p><p>“Hey, this isn’t the winning one!” Jones shook his head.</p></p><p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Sydney Rodgers was arrested and put into the county jail for two years for assault with a deadly weapon and conspiracy to commit murder. The latter charge was dropped when the jury discovered what he had tried to do. Yet another cereal killer went down in the history of New York.</p></p><p>
