      <p>It had been a long day for Professor Petrie and he was ready to go home.</p></p><p><p>But there was one more thing that he needed to do. There always was. Tonight he needed to run one more test in the BTTC--Beta Tachyon Testing Centre. He felt as if this was all pointless, the endless experimentation. He knew that as a &quot;man of science,&quot; he should readily engage himself with the material and revel in every failed experiment, knowing that it was one step closer to the final successful test. But as of late, he had grown weary. Beta tachyons were unlikely to yield any significant breakthroughs - at least at this current time.</p><p>Those damned tiny mysterious particles had been - ironically - the largest part of his life for the better part of three years and he had yet to really make any tangible progress that he could report back to the higher-ups at the National Research Laboratory. But he couldn&#39;t complain as much as he wanted to; he had received a multiple-million dollar grant to research beta tachyons of the course of five years and the NRL would not appreciate their head researcher quitting due to lack of interest.</p><p>And it was not that beta tachyons weren&#39;t interesting, on the contrary; they were one of the most interesting phenomena that Petrie had ever encountered in his tenure as a particle physicist. They defied explanation, put simply. While every other piece of physical matter in the observable universe moved in the direction generally referred to as &quot;forward&quot; in time, beta tachyons moved backwards - and much faster than the speed at which the rest of the universe moved. In fact, they moved so fast that they simultaneously occupied every location in the universe simultaneously--but only one position in time. Unlike traditional particles, “tardyons,” which theoretically occupied only one location in both space and time, beta tachyons occupied every point in space, making only their position in time pertinent. Alpha tachyons, or traditional tachyons, still moved faster than light, differentiating them from beta tachyons, but still could only be said to occupy one point at any given time. And it was this seeming paradox that had interested Petrie in the first place as a grad student at Stanford. As a young, idealistic twenty-something, he strove to understand the universe and believed in earnest that it could be done.</p><p>But as the years (fifteen of them) had passed, Petrie believed less and less in the initial convictions that had sent him freewheeling down the path of scientific pursuits. And he had lost momentum, grown stagnant. And he had doomed himself in his own mind to this desperate sort of existential crisis, only faintly believing anymore that science produced miracles.</p><p>He lifted his head from his lab notes and looked through the glass plate window that separated him from the testing facility floor. His assistant, Joshua Jeffries, was inspecting the entanglement chamber, checking for loose screws or misaligned valves. Petrie smiled. Joshua reminded him of himself at that age, full of youthful vigorous and enthusiasm, free of disillusionment and stale negativity bred by years of missing results and absent applications. Petrie hoped that Joshua would stay the young grad student forever, never grow into the embittered old man who smashed particles into each other seemingly out of spite for the universe. But he knew that one day, given the current course, even Joshua would lose interest.</p></p><p><p>Joshua turned on the rest of the lights on the facility floor. The sudden brightness caused Petrie’s nose to itch and he fought a sneeze for a few seconds. He lost the battle and sneezed into the elbow of his lab coat.</p></p><p><p>It was time. Joshua was heading back from the entanglement chamber. He entered the small observation room and took a seat next to Petrie.</p><p>&quot;Everything&#39;s ready,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;Good job,&quot; Petrie said. &quot;Prepare for entanglement interference pattern generation.”</p><p>The premise of this experiment was simple, given an understanding of the basic concepts behind it. Petrie and Jeffries would bombard beta tachyons with alpha tachyons. The resulting entanglement would slow the beta tachyons not in space, but in time. The interference pattern would be measured by a set of instruments in the chamber on the testing facility floor. If Petrie’s theory was correct (and he had very little faith that it was), the instruments would record the interference pattern BEFORE the start of the test. To further failproof the experiment, the beta tachyons would be slowed in a very specific pattern. In much the same way as amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM) transmit data with radio waves, the interference patterns would produce an interpretable signal that could be picked up and read by the machine several seconds before Petrie started the experiment.</p><p>Petrie pressed a button and started the timer. If his calculations on the momentum of beta tachyons were correct, the instrument was now receiving the message he was about to send. There was no method in place for checking remotely, lest he create a paradox on his first attempt. Joshua powered on the generators and monitored the energy input, readying a wave of alpha tachyons from the particle accelerator. The timer ticked up to ten seconds. There was suddenly a flash of light and the generator powered down. The experiment was complete, anticlimactically. Petrie walked out to the test chamber. He opened its door and stepped inside. The computer inside filled the small chamber with a blue glow.</p><p>The screen read:</p></p><p><p>00:00:00.00100 Eureka</p></p><p><p>The machine had received his message at precisely one millisecond into the experiment--nine seconds and nine hundred ninety nine milliseconds before it had been sent.</p></p><p><p>What followed was a whirlwind of speaking tours--Harvard, Stanford, MIT. He was hailed in the scientific community as a “revolutionary,” “our Einstein,” “a hero for a new age.” He had effectively proven a limited form of time travel--information could be sent backward in time. This simple fact was latched onto by the media and distributed to the tabloids in the form of such headlines as “Perilous Professor Petrie Tries Time Travel” and other overtly false statements. In reality, Petrie was unsure of exactly how revolutionary this discovery truly was; after all, he had not travelled in time, and he had hardly sent a message to the past. The only way that the message could have been deciphered was through his machine specifically built for deciphering the message he knew that he was sending to himself. It was an unreasonable stretch of the imagination to say that he could alter history--in fact, the only practical purpose of his experiment was necessarily limited.</p><p>But his own pessimism would not pay his bills, and so he continued to tout his own accomplishments and usher in the new age of time travel. But even in the face of public laud, he was forced to focus his efforts on more practical, tangible applications for his new discovery. Was it indeed possible to send a man back in time?</p></p><p><p>Now-Dr. Jeffries and he discussed this matter at length one evening after a conference in Bern.</p><p>“And did you see Dr. Finkel?” Jeffries laughed and set down his coffee mug.</p><p>“Yes, yes.” Petrie was distracted.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Jeffries asked.</p><p>“Where do we go from here?”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“We can’t just rest on our laurels. The fact remains; no one knows if it’s possible to send an object, much less a man, back in time. It’s all well and good that we can send messages back, but what about matter? Even simple energy? All we’ve sent back so far are interference waves, data.”</p><p>Jeffries took another swig of his coffee and, holding his mug, stared off into space for a moment. “What if…” he trailed off.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>He looked back at Petrie. “What if we could do more than simply alter beta tachyons?”</p><p>“How so? We can’t stop them--their superluminal speed is the very thing that makes them useful.”</p><p>“No no,” Jeffries said. “We harness them. They’re essentially omni-present, correct? Their position in space is irrelevant as they are simultaneously at every point.”</p><p>“Correct,” said Petrie, starting to grasp where his former assistant was going.</p><p>“What if we were to use their temporal momentum to propel an object back in time? We could tether, in a sense, the beta tachyons to spatial particles and instead of moving them anywhere in space, move them in time.”</p><p>Petrie lit up as he grasped the concept. “We could bond the two with alpha tachyons, using them like electrons in a molecule--holding two disparate particles together.”</p><p>“Precisely.”</p></p><p><p>Jeffries handed Petrie a shallow cone--like a large Kasa, a conical Japanese hat. It was covered in bumps of varying sizes. Petrie placed it on the table in front of him and pulled a ball bearing from his pocket.</p><p>“This is the observable three-dimensional universe,” he told the assembled panel. They had gathered there to review his grant proposal for his upcoming research. He pointed to the shallow cone on the table. “And this is all of space-time, in a five-dimensional model. The first three dimensions, with which most everyone is familiar with, are a single one-dimensional point, which this ball bearing represents. Time is now the z-axis. The further down the ball goes, the further in time it is. The bottom edge of the cone represents the end of the universe. This is where beta-tachyons are generated from.”</p><p>“And why exactly is that?” A panel member asked.</p><p>“Well, the ultimate fate of the universe, which is a fixed point in time, leads to a total collapse of the universe as it is ripped apart by phantom dark energy. All mass is dissembled into elementary particles, which are given infinite momentum due to the density of the dark energy. The elementary particles, which cannot be broken down further, travelling at an infinite speed, are what we know today as beta tachyons. They are travelling backward in time, as I have proved earlier and will eventually reach the starting of the universe, at which point they will lose momentum and reconglomerate into all matter and energy at the start of the universe.”</p><p>“So what you’re positing is that the universe is cyclical.”</p><p>“Of course. As anyone is aware, both energy and matter can neither be created nor destroyed, but it can be sent back in time to create itself,” he paused for a moment to take a drink of water. “The bumps on this cone represent events. Obviously in a perfect model there would be an infinite number of bumps and an infinitely small ball bearing, but this will have to do.”</p><p>He placed the ball bearing on the very point of the cone. It teetered for a second and then began rolling down the slope, hitting bumps and changing its course as it went. Petrie placed a finger on it to stop it.</p><p>“As you can see, the ball has begun rolling in an essentially random direction. The direction in which it is heading represents the fifth dimension--probability. In an archaic multiple universe theory, one could jump to another of an infinite number of ball bearings which had hit a number of the same bumps, but not all--making it a very similar but slightly different universe. The further one jumped from the starting universe, the more different paths would have been taken. In this model, there is only one universe, but it has a chance to go down any path.” He rolled the ball bearing back up a little to where it had been just a second previous. “now if we were able to go back in time, we could only slightly alter the past--there would be no way to simply jump to the other side of the cone. But simply because we had gone back in time, we would have altered several variables which determined the direction in which the ball/universe would roll--namely momentum and direction.”</p><p>“Pardon me, doctor, but what does this have to do with beta tachyons?”</p><p>Jeffries stepped forward. “I’ll take it from here. Beta tachyons, travelling backwards in time, essentially climb up the slope toward the point at which the universe starts. We are slowly drifting down, which provides our perception of the passage of time. If we are able to bond temporal particles, beta tachyons, with physical particles, we will be able to push,” here Petrie slowly rolled the ball back up the slope, “our perception of the universe backward. Obviously we cannot go backward in time further than our own existence, but we should be able to go backward.” He looked at Petrie and back at the panel. “Our proposal is in front of you with an outline of the funds we’d need to perform this experiment. Are there any questions?”</p></p><p><p>It was the day they had been waiting for for fifteen months--fifteen months of intense calculation, research, and experimentation. They were going to send a man back in time. They had performed experiments sending physical objects back in time with no luck. Because the beta tachyons only moved objects in time and not in space, any particles or objects sent back in time would revert to the location that they had been at the time to which they were sent back. They would not stay in one physical location while they shifted temporal locations. Sure, the outcome of the universe may have changed because of that small shift backwards, but it was not to an extent that could be observed with any contemporary equipment. So they had decided to send a man back--Professor Petrie himself. He had made the decision on his own. After all, there was no observable harm done to objects that had been sent back--they simply stayed in the chamber. Computers stayed powered and animals stayed alive. Presumably they had been sent back and on their journey back down through time had been used again for the same experiment in a universe that had slightly, yet imperceptibly, altered its course. The alteration was of course not so significant that the test subjects were no longer being used in the changed universe.</p><p>And so Professor Petrie volunteered.</p></p><p><p>He stepped into the test chamber and smoothed his labcoat. Ten seconds to ignition. He felt the whir of turbines cooling the massive generators and heard the high pitched whine and then there was a flash of light.</p><p>The sudden brightness caused Petrie’s nose to itch and he fought a sneeze for a few seconds. He suppressed it and shook his head to clear the tingling sensation.</p><p>It was time. Joshua was heading back from the entanglement chamber.</p></p><p>
