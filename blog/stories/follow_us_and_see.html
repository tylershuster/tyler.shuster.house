      <h1>Follow Us and See</h1>
      
      <p>Feb 8, 2013</p></p><p><p>&quot;Who are you?&quot; the woman standing on the side of the road asked.</p></p><p><p>&quot;Follow us and see,&quot; the woman running said without breaking her gaze directly ahead. She was the only person that the first woman had seen running while she had been standing on the side of the road.</p></p><p><p>The first woman did not know of whom the second woman was speaking as she was alone, but they began to run together. The first woman was tired easily and asked if she could stop.</p></p><p><p>The second woman said that she was free to, but that she would keep on running, and so the first woman stopped for a while and caught her breath. The second woman was running steadily but not quickly and soon the first woman caught back up to her. She tired soon thereafter and repeated her question. The second woman replied the same way. And so the first woman stopped for a little while, and then caught back up. She was growing exasperated and asked the second woman “who are you?”</p></p><p><p>The second woman replied “follow us and see.”</p></p><p><p>“Who is ‘us’?” the first woman asked.</p></p><p><p>“We are,” came the answer and so the first woman continued to run with her. After a number of times stopping to catch her breath, she settled into a rhythm and ran alongside the second woman. The only sound was their breathing, the first woman heaving more laboriously than the second. The first woman asked “how long have you been running?”</p></p><p><p>&quot;Since the beginning,&quot; the second woman replied.</p></p><p><p>The first woman no longer had enough breath to keep up her questioning and kept running. Along the way they passed a number of people standing on the side of the road. A few were walking along the road, and some were stopping in groups to talk among those gathered. A few bystanders asked various questions like “Where are you running to?” “Why are you running?” and “who are you?” The first woman tried to answer them all, but could not. The second woman provided no solution.</p></p><p><p>The first woman asked the second “how many people have you seen while you’ve been running?”</p></p><p><p>&quot;All of them,&quot; the second woman replied.</p></p><p><p>Frustrated with these answers, the first woman continued to run in silence. After a while she mustered the gumption to ask another question, expecting a very particular answer. “Where are you running to?”</p></p><p><p>This time there was no reply from the second woman.</p></p><p><p>&quot;To the end,&quot; she answered her own question. &quot;But where is the end?&quot;</p></p><p><p>&quot;It is not here,&quot; the second woman replied.</p></p><p><p>Stymied by these answers, the first woman continued to run.</p></p><p><p>A long time passed and no words had been exchanged between the two of them. There was only the air passing in and out and the music of feet upon the way. The first woman could see only the bobbing horizon and the people on the side of the road, to whose queries she replied simply “follow us and see.” None did.</p></p><p><p>After a while the first woman had said this many times and it had become automatic. There was no answer that she could give them that would suffice. Finally a woman on the side of the road was interested enough to keep pace with her. “Who are you?” she asked.</p></p><p><p>&quot;Follow us and see,&quot; she said.</p></p><p><p>&quot;But,&quot; she said, &quot;you are running by yourself.&quot;</p></p><p><p>“We are,” the woman replied.</p></p><p>
